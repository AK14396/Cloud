[Q2B]
1]Open the terminal in your VM instance and run the following command to install Docker:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install docker.io

2]Once Docker is installed, you can create a Docker image for Python/Java by creating a Dockerfile in a directory and running the following commands:
	
	# Dockerfile for Python
	FROM python:3
	COPY . /app		
	WORKDIR /app
	CMD python main.py

	# Dockerfile for Java
	FROM openjdk:11
	COPY . /app
	WORKDIR /app
	RUN javac Main.java
	CMD java Main


3]In the directory where the Dockerfile is located, run the following command to build the Docker image:

	docker build -t my-python-image 

OR	docker build -t my-java-image .

4]Create a small program to show your prn number on this. Here's an example Python program:

	# main.py

	print("PRN: 1234567890")

5]Run the Docker image with the following command:
	
	docker run my-python-image


[Q2c]

1]Tag the Docker image with the registry name using the following command:

	docker tag my-python-image my-registry.com/my-python-image

2]Log in to the registry using the following command:
	
	docker login my-registry.com

3]Push the Docker image to the registry using the following command:

	docker push my-registry.com/my-python-image
